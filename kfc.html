                      <p>Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) is world-renowned for its fried chicken. Known by the face of an old man with a white beard, the brand indeed has a crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside history.

The journey started way back in the 1930s when a man named, Harland Sanders, refused to give up in the face of adversity and by the time of his death, in 1980s, became a multi-millionaire by successfully building the world’s most popular fast-food chain – KFC.</p>
